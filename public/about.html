<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate and versatile individual with dual Bachelor's degrees in Fashion Design and Web Development. My diverse skill set bridges the worlds of creativity and technology, allowing me to approach projects with a unique perspective. I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to combine my love for fashion and my technical expertise.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been highly involved in extracurricular activities, from school through university. I had the honor of serving as Student Council Chairman multiple times, where I developed strong leadership and teamwork skills. In addition, I have a background in music, having completed music school, which fuels my love for artistic expression.</p>

<p>When I’m not designing or coding, you can find me drawing and exploring new ways to channel my creativity. I believe that creativity knows no bounds, and I strive to bring that philosophy into everything I do!</p>
